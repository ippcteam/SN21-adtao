"""Detecting copied models, and deciding who has precedence over a copy.

THE ATTACK, as reported by a miner on 2026-08-06 and confirmed against the
code before anything here was written:

    Images must be public and anonymously pullable, so anyone watching the
    chain can pull a newly committed model and re-commit it under their own
    hotkey within minutes. The admission gate scores a model against the
    naive baseline and does not look at duplication, so a copy is admitted
    on the original's merits. An identical container produces identical
    predictions, therefore an identical standing — and the curve's tie-break
    was (standing desc, hotkey ASC), so the copy with the lexicographically
    smaller hotkey took the slot.

That last step is the part that made copying strictly profitable rather than
merely possible, and it is the part fixed here.

TWO KINDS OF COPY, TWO DETECTORS
    Same bytes     two hotkeys commit the SAME digest. Objective, provable
                   from chain alone, no inference.
    Same behaviour a rebuilt image has a different digest but produces
                   identical predictions. Two independently built models do
                   not agree to full float precision across a whole basket;
                   agreement at that resolution is the same model.

PRECEDENCE, NOT PUNISHMENT
    This module answers "who was first", which is a fact, and deliberately
    does NOT decide what happens to the copy — whether it is excluded,
    zero-weighted or left to compete is a governance call with real economic
    consequences. Ranking by precedence already removes the free win; the
    policy layer can go further when it is ruled on.

    Precedence is the block height at which a digest was first committed.
    Chain order is the one ordering a copier cannot manipulate after the
    fact: they can grind a favourable hotkey, but they cannot commit before
    the model they are copying existed.

Pure module: no chain calls, no I/O. Everything arrives as data.
